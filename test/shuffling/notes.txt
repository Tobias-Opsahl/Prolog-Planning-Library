Shuffling is a domain designed to reveal h_diff's non-admissibility, but 
revealed another bug in the solver. 

The positions are placed from left to right, and blocks are put on top of them.
The goal is to get block1 on position1, block2 on position2, and so on. The initial
state is a shuffle of this. The blocks can be moved by a 2shuffle, which means to 
neighbouring blocks get swapped, or a 3shuffle. The 3shuffle can either be done in 
the right or left direction. 

This can reveal h_diff non-admissibility, because it assumes that each fact in the 
goal state takes at least one action to satisfy. In other words, if there are 3 
facts in the goal state that are not fulfilled in the current state, h_diff estimates
3 moves. However, in this domain it is possible to change all 3 at once, with a 
3shuffle. This means that h_diff can overestimate, and thereby not giving the optimal
solution. 

The h_dist is specially implemented for this domain.
