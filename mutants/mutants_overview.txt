The mutants are tested on h_0 and h_max, since they are the only 
admissible heuristics. h_manhattan and h_dist are adimissible, but they 
only work for sliding and shuffling, respectivly. 

h_0 passed, 36/36
h_max passed, 36/36
h_diff failed, 35 tests passed, 1 test failed
h_add failed, 32 tests passed, 4 tests failed
h_manhattan failed, 29 tests passed, 7 tests failed
h_dist failed, 5 tests passed, 31 tests failed

forward:
	forward-1: Not checking negative effects.
	forward-2: Not checking positive effects.
	forward-3: Not sorting the predicates and effects

Mutants idea:

	Revisitig Nodes
	Not updating Visited correctly
	Not backtracking solution
	Changing arithmetics. Wa-star, greedy bfs
	Changing set-operations, dif, intersection, union etc.
	Domain that exposes h_diffs non-admissility (and h_dist)
	Change initial 0 values 
	Remove NextNodes = []
	Old visited to new visited
	Dont pop from heap, only find
	Overlook negative effects in Forward
